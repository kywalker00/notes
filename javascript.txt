JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic 
typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. 
Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party 
libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the 
user's device.

I love JS. JS is very interesting.
